# rocDecode Python Binding

> [!NOTE]
> The published documentation is available at [rocPyDecode](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocPyDecode/en/latest/index.html) in an organized, easy-to-read format, with search and a table of contents. The documentation source files reside in the `docs` folder of this repository. As with all ROCm projects, the documentation is open source. For more information on contributing to the documentation, see [Contribute to ROCm documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/contribute/contributing.html).

The rocDecode Python Binding, rocPyDecode, is a tool that allows users to access rocDecode APIs in both Python and C/C++ languages. It works by connecting Python and C/C++ libraries, enabling function calling and data passing between the two languages. The `rocpydecode.so` library is a wrapper that facilitates the use of rocDecode APIs that are written primarily in C/C++ language within Python.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Required compiler support
>   * C++17
>   * Threads

>[!NOTE]
> * All package installs are shown with the `apt` package manager. Use the appropriate package manager for your operating system.

### Prerequisites setup script

For your convenience, we provide the setup script, [rocPyDecode-requirements.py](rocPyDecode-requirements.py), which installs all required dependencies. Run this script only once on bare metal, if using docker please see below instructions.

```shell
python3 rocPyDecode-requirements.py
```

## rocPyDecode install

The installation process uses the following steps:

* [ROCm-supported hardware](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html) install verification

* Install ROCm `6.3.0` or later with [amdgpu-install](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/how-to/amdgpu-install.html) with `--usecase=rocm`

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Use **either** [package install](#package-install) **or** [source install](#source-install) as described below.

### Package install

Install rocPyDecode runtime, and test packages.

* Runtime package - `rocpydecode` only provides the python bindings for rocDecode
* Test package - `rocpydecode-test` provides ctest to verify installation

#### `Ubuntu`

  ```shell
  sudo apt-get install rocpydecode rocpydecode-test
  ```

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Python module: To use python module, set PYTHONPATH:
>   + `export PYTHONPATH=/opt/rocm/lib:$PYTHONPATH`

### Source install

To build rocPyDecode from source and install, follow the steps below:

* Clone rocPyDecode source code

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/rocPyDecode.git
```

#### CMake install

* Instructions for building rocPyDecode with the **CMake**
  + run the requirements script to install all the dependencies required:
  ```shell
  cd rocPyDecode
  python3 rocPyDecode-requirements.py
  ```

  + run the below commands to build rocPyDecode:
  ```shell
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ../
  make -j8
  sudo make install
  ```

  + run tests - [test option instructions](https://github.com/ROCm/MIVisionX/wiki/CTest)
  ```shell
  make test
  ```

>[!NOTE]
> To run tests with verbose option, use `make test ARGS="-VV"`.

#### Pip3 install

```shell
cd rocPyDecode
sudo pip3 install .
```
>[!NOTE]
> `sudo` access is required

#### Creating python distribution wheel
* Option 1:
```shell
cd rocPyDecode
sudo python3 build_rocpydecode_wheel.py
```
* Option 2:
```shell
cd rocPyDecode
sudo python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
```
>[!NOTE]
> * Generated `.whl` file will be located under subfolder `./dist/`
> * `sudo` access is required

#### docker environment install

```shell
cd rocPyDecode
python rocPyDecode-docker-install.py 
```
>[!NOTE]
> Do NOT use `sudo`

### creating rocPyDecode conda package
* Information on how to create and install rocPyDecode conda package is located [here](https://github.com/ROCm/rocPyDecode/blob/develop/conda-recipe/README.md).

## Run CTest

This will run python samples and show pass/fail.
>[!NOTE]
> install rocPydecode before running tests

### Dependencies:
```shell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple hip-python
```

### Run tests with source
```shell
mkdir rocpydecode-test && cd rocpydecode-test
cmake ../rocPyDecode/tests
ctest -VV
```

### Run tests with rocpydecode-test package

Test package will install ctest module to test rocPyDecode. Follow below steps to test package install

```shell
mkdir rocpydecode-test && cd rocpydecode-test
cmake /opt/rocm/share/rocpydecode/tests
ctest -VV
```
>[!NOTE]
> Make sure all required libraries are in your PATH
> ```shell
> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/rocm/lib
> export PYTHONPATH=/opt/rocm/lib:$PYTHONPATH
> ```

## Run Sample Scripts

* Sample scripts and instructions to run them can be found [here](samples/)
